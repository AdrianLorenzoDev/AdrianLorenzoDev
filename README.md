## Hello!

**My name is [Adri√°n Lorenzo](https://adrianlorenzo.dev)** and I live in Gran Canaria, Spain, with my family! 

**I am Computer Science Engineer who is currently working as a Software Engineer at [The Agile Monkeys](https://www.theagilemonkeys.com)**, an amazing company with outstanding people. 

I **love creating things with the purpose of delivering something useful for people that may need help or to just try to improve their lives**, and I use my computer science knowledge to achieve this goal.

I'm in love with **Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision**, but I quite enjoy everything related to computer science (For example, metaprogramming, discrete optimization, and security).

Programming languages, frameworks, and libraries are great tools that help me create the things I work on. However, I don't feel linked to any of them emotionally. **I use them as tools to achieve an objective, but my objective is not to use them.**

Some of the programming languages that I enjoy using and that I have used a lot are **Swift, Go, Kotlin, Python, Typescript, C/C++, Java, Rust.**

Some other tools, like frameworks, libraries, and services that I have used to work on my projects are: 

- **User interfaces**: SwiftUI, Combine, Android Jetpack, Kotlin Coroutines.
- **Machine learning**: Tensorflow, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pillow. 
- **Backend applications**: Serverless Framework, Spring Boot, Express.js, Flask.
- **Cloud providers**: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform.
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose.
- **Continuous delivery and continuous deployment**: GitHub Actions, Bitrise.

With all of these technologies, **I have worked on very different projects related to software and its capability to bring value to people.** Solutions like cloud-based applications, mobile applications, machine learning models, smart agents, web applications, and much more!

**I'm open to help and collaborate on things that can bring value to the community.** If that is the case, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
